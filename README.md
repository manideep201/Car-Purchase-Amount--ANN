CAR PRUCHASE AMOUNT PREDICTION USING ANN 🚗💰
Predicting Car Purchase Amount Based on Customer Data
🔍 Overview
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the amount a customer is likely to spend on purchasing a car based on various factors such as age, income, credit score, and other financial indicators.

📌 Key Features
✅ Built using TensorFlow & Keras
✅ Uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for prediction
✅ Trained on customer demographic and financial data
✅ Evaluates model performance using R² Score & Loss Function
✅ Deployed in Google Colab for training & testing

🔧 Technologies Used

Python 🐍
TensorFlow & Keras 🧠
Pandas & NumPy 📊
Matplotlib & Seaborn 📉
Google Colab ⚡
📈 How It Works

Data preprocessing: Clean & normalize input data
Build ANN model with multiple layers
Adam Optimizer for ANN
Train & evaluate the model using MSE & R² Score
Make predictions on new customer data
